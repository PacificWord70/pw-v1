                    Over the 2020 summer, I worked as a Virtual Software Engineering Intern at Capital One. 
                    I helped build FortDocs, the core document repository for over 45 million documents within their Small Business Technology department. 
                    I worked with another intern to onboard the Credit Bureau Dispute team to this platform for upload, search, and edit capabilities. 
                    FortDocs is a web-based platform and is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. 
                    The data is stored with an Alfresco Database backend that utilizes OpenCMIS and Chassis Microservices to allow for more utility. 
                    For our project, we primarily worked with our Java SpringBoot API that interfaced with the Angular UI made of Typescript and Javascript. 
                    I had a great time working with this team and learning more about web-development including entitlements, catalogs, and the Angular framework. 
                    I'm grateful to have enjoyed my summer and experience the virtual work environment in these changing times. 
                    From this summer I gained remote working skills in communication and productivity as well as technical skills in development.

                    Over the 2019 summer, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Capital One, in Mclean, Virginia. 
                    I worked with one of their Risk and Compliance teams overlooking their data pool in the public cloud. 
                    I helped design and create a web-based Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance control tool. 
                    I built this application using Material Design Boostrap, Node.js, Express, Postgresql, and the AWS Relational Database. 
                    Over this time I also learned about audit operations, ITGC processes, and user interface practices while 
                    working with local and remote professionals. It was a great experience to blueprint plus enhance the purpose and 
                    user experience of this brand new tool at such a large and inovative company.

                    Over the summer of 2018, I participated as one of 25 interns in Rockwell 
                    Collin's Summer Engineering Projects Program (SEPP), in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I used C++ and Python to modify 
                    company flight management software for a semi-autonomous fixed wing drone. 
                    I worked with three teammates to explore the possibility of transforming the 
                    existing software into a civilian commercial product. My team and I worked 
                    with two other teams to integrate each of our experimental projects onto one 
                    physical system. Our team used Agile to delegate work to meet summer deadlines. 
                    And at the end of the summer, we displayed our work to company executives 
                    through a final presentation and written report.

                    Over two years, I was a UTA for CS180 and CS180x. 
                    CS180 is the introductory computer science course for freshman at Purdue University. 
                    CS 180x is the online version of CS180 for high schoolers and other students around the world. 
                    These classes use object-oriented Java to teach programming basics and principles. 
                    Some topics include classes, methods, inheritence, threads, Android development, and networking.
                    As a UTA I aided students during lab sessions, to comprehend and learn the material, and exams, 
                    to understand the requierments. 
                    I worked with other undergraduate and graduate TAs to complete weekly class objectives.
